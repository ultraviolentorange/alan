<b>Alan Turing</b> was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, <br>
philosopher, and theoretical biologist. <br>
Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, <br>
providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing <br>
machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely <br>
considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. <br>
<br>
<b>alan</b> is an open-source tool by @ultraviolentorange that helps in decoding encrypted text. <br>
It's pretty customizable, but the best feature about it is that it will decrypt the text <br>
even when you don't know how it was encrypted. <br>
alan tries all suported encryption methods, generates plaintext candidates and filters <br>
them using correctness-evaluating function based on a dictionary. <br>
<br>
<b>alan</b> is in C++ completely, because it's oriented at optimal performance in terms of <br>
execution time and memory. There are weird optimizations and hacks all over the code, <br>
and multiple "good" programming practices are ignored. <br>
