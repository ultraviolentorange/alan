# alan 

Alan Turing was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, <br>
philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, 
providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing
machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely 
considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

alan is an open-source tool by @ultraviolentorange that helps in decoding encrypted text.
It's pretty customizable, but the best feature about it is that it will decrypt the text 
even when you don't know how it was encrypted.
alan tries all suported encryption methods, generates plaintext candidates and filters 
them using correctness-evaluating function based on a dictionary.

alan is in C++ completely, because it's oriented at optimal performance in terms of 
execution time and memory. There are weird optimizations and hacks all over the code, 
and multiple "good" programming practices are ignored.

You are mostly welcome to be a part of the project by reporting issues and suggesting
improvements!
